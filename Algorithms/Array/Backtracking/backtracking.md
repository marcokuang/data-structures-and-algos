# 3 keys to backtracking

1. Our choice
   - The character we place and recurse on
2. Our constraints
   - at each point/ after one recursive call we have less characters in the array/string to work with
3. Our Goal
   - n placements, n choices 
    > the final permutation that has the same length as the original array.
